# Hello, I'm Edgar 👋

I'm an IT professional transitioning into Web Development.  
For the last few years I've worked with infrastructure and security in Windows environments (Active Directory, SCCM, Matrix42, Nexthink, Trellix AV and firewall), mainly in industrial context.

Right now I'm focusing on **web and back-end development** through bootcamps (DIO, TripleTen and GFT Start .NET) and a **Cyber Security** course at Trainning Education.

🌎 From Brazil  
🎓 BSc in Computer Engineering – Facens  
💼 Background: Windows Server, Active Directory, PowerShell, SCCM, IT support & security  
📚 Currently learning: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, .NET, Git/GitHub  
🚀 Goal: build solid, well-structured projects and get my first role as a Junior Developer.

Feel free to check my repositories and reach out 🙂
